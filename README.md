## DAILY SAFETY INSPECTION CHECKLIST

The Safety Checklist Web Form allows inspectors to complete a set of predefined safety questions, with the option to answer each with "Yes" or "No." Additional fields allow users to provide their name, select the current date and time, and leave optional comments for each question. This form is designed to capture essential safety information in a standardized format for easy review and record-keeping.
The site is translatable in both Arabic and English, ensuring accessibility for users who prefer either language. This bilingual support enhances usability and ensures that essential safety information can be accurately recorded by users in both languages.

## Approach and Thought Process

The project was designed to be user-friendly, secure, and scalable. Hereâ€™s an overview of the design approach:

#### 1.Form Design: The form uses radio buttons for "Yes" and "No" answers, with optional text areas for comments. This keeps the form simple while allowing for more detailed responses if needed.

#### 2.Data Validation: Laravelâ€™s validation rules ensure that the form fields contain valid inputs (e.g., name is required, date and time are valid).

#### 3.Backend Storage: Each submission is saved to a database with fields for the user's name, responses to each question, comments, date, and time. This setup makes it easy to retrieve and analyze the data later.

#### 4.Repository Design Pattern: The Repository pattern was implemented to decouple the applicationâ€™s data access layer from the business logic. By using repositories, we can easily manage data access logic and maintain a cleaner architecture, making future updates easier and more manageable.

#### 5.SOLID Principles: The project was developed in alignment with SOLID principles

#### 6.Security: User inputs are sanitized to prevent SQL injection, and only authorized users can access the form.

## Assumptions or Challenges

### Assumptions

- **The checklist questions are static and will not change over time.**
- **Users completing the checklist are trained to understand each question without additional guidance.**

### Challenges

- **Data Integrity**: Ensuring that each answer is recorded accurately in the database, especially since some fields are optional (like comments).
- **Optimized Updates**: When updating a checklist entry, the application uses the ```isDirty``` method to detect and update only the fields that have changed. This optimization reduces unnecessary database updates, improving performance and maintaining efficient use of resources.
- **User Interface Design**: Making the form easy to use while accommodating various device sizes and ensuring that the input fields are accessible and easy to interact with.
- **Security**: Ensuring that user inputs are validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks, especially given that the form might be accessible to multiple users.
